    "text": "In mathematics, the Riemannâ€“Hurwitz formula, named after Bernhard Riemann and Adolf Hurwitz, describes the relationship of the Euler characteristics of two surfaces when one is a ramified covering of the other. It therefore connects ramification with algebraic topology, in this case. Riemann was born on September 17, 1826 in Breselenz, a village near Dannenberg in the Kingdom of Hanover.",
